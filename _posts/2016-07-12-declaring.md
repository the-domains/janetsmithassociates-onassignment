  While other EMS marketing, ambulance marketing or physician group marketing
  and consulting firms concern themselves with operational efficiencies, we’re
  particularly adept at helping ambulance companies, EMS organizations and
  physicians declare their organization’s vision, culture, and image. Then we
  communicate those key elements through ambulance company branding, ambulance
  marketing, healthcare public relations and public affairs. Even government EMS
  organizations need branding, EMS marketing and market protection. Individual
  EMS leaders and physician group representatives benefit by well thought
  physician branding/marketing and positioning strategy in addition to the
  organizations’ local and trade healthcare media representation and public
  affairs. We specialize in ambulance RFP response, physician group RFP
  response, and EMS grant writing proposals/grant applications.
