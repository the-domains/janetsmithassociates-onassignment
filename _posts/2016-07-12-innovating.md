**Community Paramedic Programs, Employee Wellness, Recruitment -- Retention**

Health care is evolving and so must our clients realize the cutting edge of innovation for new out-of-hospital healthcare services like community paramedic programs, hospital partnerships to reduce re-admissions, and home visits for high acuity patients. On Assignments success is due to our associates' EMS-specific knowledge, our experience conducting focus groups and market specific research in regards to new products and services. Please ask us for examples of our work with community paramedic programs. Additionally, On Assignment has been contracted by several state ambulance associations to conduct EMS career campaigns including producing state focused recruitment videos.
